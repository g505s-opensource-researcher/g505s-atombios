8DFAE5D4-B50E-4C10-96E6-F2C266CACBB6 (VID=1002, DID=9901)
for Trinity [Radeon HD 7660D] - integrated GPU found at A10-5800K desktop APU

*** IMPORTANT NOTE 1 :

This OpROM could be used for HD 8650G integrated GPU of A10-5750M laptop APU,
which has "(VID=1002, DID=990b)" identifiers and found at G505S laptop,
but ONLY after the proprietary UEFI/BIOS patches it to correct "DID" and
fills a lot of its' variables / data structures with compatible values.

If you will try to use it AS-IS unpatched - your backlight will not work.

2nd, for Sun PRO [Radeon HD 8570A; HD 8570M] -
- discrete GPU found at laptops (MXM module HD 8570A; HD 8570M)

*** IMPORTANT NOTE 3 :

It seems that "(VID=1002, DID=6663)" (which is from Sun PRO family) is a BIOS
mistake, because OpROM human readable ASCII header - printed below - tells that
this OpROM is for Jet GPU family (R5 M230, R5 M255, R5 M420, R5 M430, R7 M435)

Judging by their list and the availability of GPUs at the modifications of
G405s/G505s laptop models, most likely it should be "(VID=1002, DID=6665)" -
- which stands for R5 M230 discrete GPU found in certain G405s/G505s versions

^^^ UPDATE :

This OpROM could be used for R5 M230 discrete GPU
which has "(VID=1002, DID=6665)" identifiers and found at G505S laptop,
but ONLY after the proprietary UEFI/BIOS patches it to correct "DID" and
fills a lot of its' variables / data structures with compatible values.
